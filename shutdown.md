## Local Environment Cleanup

### Stopping Minikube

To stop Minikube, and the VM that it runs, run minikube stop . You can bring your local cluster back online at any time by running minikube start

### Stopping Running Containers

You might still have some containers running on your machine. Try a docker ps . You can then run docker stop <container_id> to clean up any running containers

### Clearing the Build Cache

All the images that we built and ran during the course are cached on your local machine - they might be taking up to around 1GB of space. You can clean these up by running docker system prune
